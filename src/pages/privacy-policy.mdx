## Tattle Products

- At present, there is no Tattle service/tool that requires us to collect of personal data such as a phone number to provide a service. We have a beta for an Android app, but at present, it is not being launched for wide release.  
- When requesting access to datasets, individuals are asked to share their email and optionally, institutional affiliations. We need the email to provide access to data. The institutional affiliation is to help us understand how the data is being used. 
- One of Tattle's goals is to create an archive of content circulated on chat apps. In this data collection, Tattle might capture social media posts that have phone numbers or other personal data of individuals. We anonymize all data before working with it. For personal data inside posts, we obfuscate the personal details in any publication. We share this data with academics on the assumption that their own IRB reviews also prescribe similar anonymization procedures.

The Android App gives users the option to share a coarse location (IP location) since it doesnâ€™t identify any user and can be used for trends analysis. The following section further explains the working of the android app. 



## About Tattle App
The Android App is to allow anonymous crowdsourcing, and annotating of messages forwarded on WhatsApp from WhatsApp users.

## What Information does Tattle collect about users:
Besides the content users share with the app, it stores the time at which the post was submitted to the app. While submitting, the location from where the message is being shared is selected by default, but a user can opt out of this prior to submission of a post. This location is that given by your Internet service provider (not GPS).

## Why Tattle needs this information?
The three data points- content, time and location enable for deeper understanding of trends on information dissemination on WhatsApp such as:

Where do posts originate from?

Do WhatsApp videos have a shelf life or are they recycled and forwarded in newer forms?

What kind of content is circulated on WhatsApp and how is it received?

The crowdsourced data will be open-access and can be used by researchers studying spread of information and misinformation on encrypted platforms such as WhatsApp. The data will also be valuable for online information verification groups.

## Control over information:
Tattle does not collect any personal information on the user. Any user can request for access to the data being collected by the app through the contact email id.
