          <Paragraph responsive={true} size={"large"} color={"accent-3"}>
            From April to June 2021, India was ravaged by the second wave of the
            Covid-19 pandemic. With a steep increase in the number of
            infections, cities ran out of drugs, medical oxygen, hospitals and
            other necessary medical supplies. The second wave also ravaged rural
            India that had weaker public health infrastructure than urban India.{" "}
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph responsive={true} size={"large"} color={"accent-3"}>
            The second wave was a public health crisis, but also an information
            crisis. As cities ran out of medical aid, people turned to social
            media to request for resources outside their geographies and
            immediate networks. The circulation of leads for medical aid led to
            a concomitant increase in circulation of inaccurate leads.
            Fraudulent leads—of scamsters duping people of money in promise of
            medical supplies—were mixed in the pool of information leads on
            social media platforms. In addition, the status of medical leads
            changed rapidly—any available hospital beds or drugs were taken up
            within minutes of being available. Obsolete and fraudulent leads
            resulted in loss of critical time in medical care, money and
            ultimately lives. Moreover, phone numbers of individuals from
            marginalized identities, circulated for requesting or providing aid,
            were used for targeted harassment.
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph responsive={true} size={"large"} color={"accent-3"}>
            The crisis thus resulted in spontaneous volunteering—individuals and
            groups played the role of intermediaries, connecting those in need
            to verified leads for medical aid. WhatsApp, the most widely used
            social media platform in India, emerged as a natural choice to
            organize volunteering energies. WhatsApp could be used to source
            requests for help, coordinate with other volunteers and connect
            people to adequate aid. But how was WhatsApp used to surface
            actionable information and push back on inaccurate leads when the
            platform eludes centralized takedowns and moderation? How did
            individuals filter credible leads from a glut of information leads?

            This report contends that the second wave of the pandemic in India
            showed a new facet of the Information Disorder. It was driven by a
            specific typology of information—of hyperlocal information leads
            shared during a crisis. While this category of information shares
            some features with the prototypical political and medical
            misinformation, it also merits unique attention.{" "}

            We present preliminary analysis from 8 weeks of conversations in 21
            Covid-19 relief WhatsApp groups that were operational during the
            second wave of the crisis, to shed light on the information chaos
            that ensued during that period. We use vector embedding based
            machine learning to aggregate images based on visual and semantic
            similarity, and language processing techniques to make sense of the
            multi-lingual content shared on these groups. Our preliminary
            analysis suggests that:

                Even on WhatsApp, people relied heavily on other social media
                platforms such as Twitter and Instagram to find verified leads.
                Screenshots of posts from these platforms were commonly used
                method to cross-post information. Twitter has fewer than 20
                million users in India. People act as ‘go-betweens’ and connect
                WhatsApp users to information on Twitter and Instagram, giving
                content on these platforms greater reach.{" "}

                A comparison of phone leads shared in the WhatsApp groups with a
                national level database of verified leads maintained by a
                fact-checking group and with a crowdsourced database of ‘scam’
                numbers revealed a low overlap. Less than 17% of the leads were
                common between the WhatsApp groups we were tracking and the
                databases. This indicates the scale of information that was
                circulated and challenge of verifying content during the second
                wave of the pandemic in India.

                Volunteering groups asked for patient information in specific
                templates to make relief work more efficient. People shared
                doctor prescriptions, medical receipts and sensitive personal
                information (including the Biometric ID Aadhar) in these groups
                when requesting for help. Private information was circulated in
                groups of unknown persons who had come together for public
                oriented service. Public and private boundaries are more blurred
                in emergencies which demands greater attention to data deletion
                protocols by group admins.{" "}

                The frequency of conversations declined in these groups over

                to Covid-19 such as chartered accountancy related webinars,
                reflecting the use of WhatsApp in digital marketing.

            Taking note of the citizen and crowdsourced verification that sprung
            about during the second wave of the pandemic, we posit that the
            spontaneous increase in hyperlocal information demanded distributed
            but coordinated verification. While we have seen coordinated
            fact-checking operations around elections, we propose the

            information was hyperlocal and not created or propagated in
            coordination. This information did not have to be viral to be
            harmful. People had strong incentives to seek out accurate
            information. Despite deliberate reasoning, the truth status of such
            information was not easy to discern. How platforms could have best
            intervened to reduce the circulation of such content is also

            Through basic manual annotation of the text messages on the 21
            WhatsApp groups, we discovered at least 257 unique phone numbers
            shared as leads. We compared the phone numbers shared in the
            WhatsApp groups to a database of Covid-19 Helpline numbers verified
            by FactChecker.in, the oldest fact-checking group in India
            <ExternalLink href={"#footnote_3"}>³</ExternalLink>. The
            fact-checking group has been verifying Covid-19 helpline numbers

            monitoring since the beginning of the second wave. As of July 4,
            2021 the list had 510 ‘verified’ phone numbers.
            <br />
            We found that less than 15% of the leads shared in the WhatsApp text
            messages (37 of 257 leads) were captured by the FactChecker.in
            database. Accounting for the leads shared in images in these groups
            takes the tally of overlapping unique leads to 42. There were five
            leads in the images that were not contained in the text messages.{" "}

            We also compared the phone leads in the text messages against a
            crowdsourced database of scam numbers called CoViD Scam Directory.
            The database is maintained by the volunteering group, CoViD Action
            Initiative: Cov.Social⁴. Any individual could submit an entry for a
            ‘scam’ number. As of July 4, 2021, the database had 812 phone
            records of which 647 were unique. The entire database of numbers is
            not open access, but the group shared the database with us on
            request. 16 phone numbers reported as ‘scams’ on the CoViD Scam
            Directory were found in the text messages. But only 2 of the numbers
            from the CoViD Scam Directory were shared in the WhatsApp groups as
            warnings. The remaining 14 were shared as genuine leads in the
            WhatsApp groups. Since the CoViD Scam Directory is crowdsourced, all
            numbers listed in the directory can&#39;t be assumed to be scam. It
            is however notable that even in this database the overlap of numbers
            is low—less than 6% of the leads shared in the 21 WhatsApp groups
            were captured in the CoViD Scam Directory.

            We wanted to understand if the images contained similar information
            as text messages or if the information shared varied with the
            modality. We thus compared the textual content in the images with
            that of text messages. The word clouds of words in text messages and
            images hint that while the words used are common across text
            messages and images, they vary in their relative frequency. Words
            such as ‘hospital’, ‘patient’, ‘available’ are common to both text
            messages and images. But words such as ‘help’, ‘need’, ‘contact’,
            which are amongst the five most frequently used words in text

            proportion or percentage of occurrence of terms (number of times a
            term is used divided by total number of words) in both these
            datasets also shows that while words such as ‘available’, ‘blood’,
            ‘patient’, ‘oxygen’, had nearly equal representation in images and
            text messages, words such as ‘need’ and ‘help’ were significantly

            the request for medical aid was more often circulated as text

              It appears that WhatsApp was the primary channel to collect
              requests for aid, but when it came to advertising availability of
              resources, people also sought information on Twitter and
              Instagram. This analysis reveals an important role for the
              ‘go-betweens’ who connect WhatsApp users to information on Twitter
              and Instagram, giving content on these platforms greater reach
