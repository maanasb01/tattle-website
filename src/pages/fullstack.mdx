## About Tattle

Misinformation is a regular feature in conversations on chat apps in India. The effects of misinformation can be far ranging — from changes in people’s health choices to greater social tension in communities and in extreme cases violence against individuals. Tattle aims to support and scale existing fact-checking efforts by creating channels for sourcing content from chat apps in India; using machine learning to categorize and classify multilingual, multimedia content circulated on chat apps; and distributing fact checked information so that it is accessible to mobile-first audience. In the process Tattle aims to enable more transparent research on misinformation in closed networks.
