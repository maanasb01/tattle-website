## About the Project

Violence, abuse, and hate speech on web 2.0 has become pervasive to oneâ€™s experience of social media. Women and marginalized genders are amongst the worst affected.
Tattle Civic Tech along with the Centre for Internet and Society are building a user-facing web plugin to help social media users in India to moderate instances of online gender based violence (OGBV) Indian languages with a focus on the experience of persons situated at the margins of gender, caste, religion and sexuality. The project aims to move beyond the kill-switch of content take-downs and find ways to empower users to act on violent content they see online.

We're looking for a data scientist to work on the hate speech detection models that will drive the plugin. This role would entail:

- Developing and refining annotation guidelines for specified feature list.
- Planning and participating in data annotation workshops.
- Testing and deploying machine learning models for detection of OGBV in three Indian languages.
- Documenting work and supporting publications on the work.
- Supporting open source contributors.

Some skills we regard as being important for this role :

- Expertise with NLP frameworks in Python
- Experience building production level machine learning products.
- Expertise with Git/GitHub
- Strong communication skills with cross-disciplinary teams
- Prior research in moderation models is preferred but not necessary.
