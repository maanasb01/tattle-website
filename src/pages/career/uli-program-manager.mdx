Application Closing Date: 10 March 2023

## About the Position
[Uli](uli.tattle.co.in) is a project to helps people reclaim agency in protecting themselves from online gender based violence. Uli is a response to:
- The disproportionate harassment people of marginalized genders receive in India
- The lack of safety tech tools and resources for low-resource languages  

The tool was piloted in August 2022, for three languages and for Twitter. It was built in partnership with various [researchers and gender rights organizations in India and South Asia](https://uli.tattle.co.in/about). The focus for this year is to grow the partnerships and expand the corpus of data and resources driving Uli, while also working on a revenue model.

### Necessary skills: 
- Excellent written and verbal communication
- Demonstrated ability to manage projects. This entails setting deadlines, and coordinating with internal and external stakeholders to meet them
- Experience working on issues of gender rights or with communities of marginalized genders.
- Keenness to learn: this is a role in an interdisciplinary team and will have a learning curve to be able to communicate across teams and disciplines
- Since this is a project related to gender, individuals from gender and sexual minorities (women, LGBTIQA+) and other marginalised identities will be given preference. 

### Good to have:
- Interest and expertise in social media communication
- Experience building/releasing digital products
- Experience working with technologists

**Start Date:** As soon as possible.

**Location:** Remote

**Duration:** One year full time contract, extended based on performance.
