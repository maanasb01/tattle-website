## Qualitative Research: Uli

Date of Posting: 15 February 2023

## About the Position
[Uli](uli.tattle.co.in) is a project to helps people reclaim agency in protecting themselves from online gender based violence. Uli is a response to:
- The disproportionate harassment people of marginalized genders receive in India
- The inadequate attention given by platforms to non-anglophone social media users.  
The tool was piloted in August 2022, for three languages and for Twitter. It was built in partnership with various [researchers and gender rights organizations in India and South Asia](https://uli.tattle.co.in/about). The focus for this year is to grow the partnerships and expand the corpus of data and resources driving Uli, while also working on a revenue model. 

We're looking for a qualitative researcher to work with the technical development team and the program manager to develop the structure of a crowdsourced lexicon of abuse. This will entail a detailed literature review as well as iterating through testing in real-world setting. 

### Necessary skills: 
- Ability to independently scope and execute research ideas.
- Ability to sift through, compile and derive insights from academic literature.   
- Excellent documentation skills.
- Record of presenting complex ideas to a general audience.  

### Good to have:
- Prior experience in working on topics in human-computer interaction (HCI).
- Record of publishing and presenting at academic venues.

**Start Date:** As soon as possible.

**Location:** Remote

**Duration:** Part time position based on deliverables. 
It can be combined with [another research position on the project](https://tattle.co.in/career/uli-research-2/) for a six-month full-time position. But this will only be considered for individuals who have research interests/skills across both roles.  

**Remuneration:** Based on experience. 

**Deadline:** Rolling
