<h1 style={{lineHeight:"1.5em"}}> Project with GitHub to develop indices for public policy, international development and economic development.</h1> 

This project has concluded. 

## Background

In late 2021, GitHub put out an [RFP](https://github.blog/2021-08-31-request-for-proposals-defining-standardized-github-metrics/) to help the platform understand how it could release metrics from the public activity on the platform that could be helpful for public policy, international development and economics research. 

Tattle's mandate for creating datasets that enable research on misinformation needs us to closely understand how platforms can and should release data for research while also balancing user interests. We leveraged this expertise to work with GitHub's Social Impact and Policy teams to match needs in public policy, international development and economics research with the data sharing possibilities at GitHub. The blog released by GitHub at the launch of the project, can be found [here](https://socialimpact.github.com/insights/standardized-github-metrics-project-launch/)

Between February 2022 to August 2022 we conduced one-on-one interviews and focus group discussions with researchers and practitioners in the three disciplies. We then submitted a report to GitHub on the process through which the metrics should be conceptualized and released, and a suggestive list of metrics.
