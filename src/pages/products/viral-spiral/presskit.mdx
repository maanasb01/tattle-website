## About Us

Viral Spiral is an adaptive digital card game about sharing news on the Internet. The game reflects the ways and reasons misinformation is shared, letting players experience first hand the temptation to share fake news for their own gain and face the consequences of the harm it causes around them.

Its is supported by the [Pluralism and Civic Exchange grant](https://www.mercatus.org/features/mercatus-program-pluralism-civil-exchange-announces-first-cohort-grant-recipients) from the Mercatus Center.
